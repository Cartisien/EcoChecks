		<h2>1. Reducing the environmental impact of hosting</h2>
		In 2005, the amount of electricity consumed by data centers globally was
		equivalent to the production of 14 coal-fired 1,000-megawatt power plants. Given
		the huge growth in the technology sector since then, the impact would be even
		more devastating today, particularly when you take into account that traditional
		coal-fired electricity generation spews around 1,970 pounds of carbon dioxide
		into the atmosphere per megawatt hour. As educated, professional people we know
		that it goes well beyond a desire to reduce our own business impact on the
		environment and becomes more of a.

		<h2>2. Responding to customer concerns</h2>
		Long gone are the days when environmental concerns were the realm of
        hippies ─ it’s now very much mainstream. The average consumer wants to
        reduce his and her carbon footprint and insists that companies they do
        business with do the same. This demand goes right up the supply chain,
        past the products that companies sell, to their administrative
        infrastructure and ancillary services such as web hosting. By hosting
        with a green provider you can get ahead of the curve and have a distinct
        edge over your competitors.

		<h2>3. Helping your clients, helping you boost your bottom line</h2>
		A great aspect of hosting on a server powered by 100% renewable energy
        is that you can advertise this fact on sites you develop for your
        clients. It will help those clients boost their own sales ─ a great
        selling feature for your own services you can highlight in proposals.

		<h2>4. An economical choice</h2>
		While green web hosting used to be expensive and lean on features,
        you’ll find that pricing nowadays is akin to typical web hosting. The
        more investment that occurs in renewable energy, the lower the
        infrastructure costs, until hopefully one day electricity generation by
        environmentally destructive methods such as coal-fired generation
        becomes a shameful memory. The huge investment in renewable energy has
        already brought prices down which has flowed on to hosting companies.
        For example,

		<h2>5. Choosing a green web hosting company</h2>
		Quite a few web hosts have jumped on the green bandwagon in recent
        years, which is wonderful to see. Unfortunately, with some it’s just a
        token gesture, a marketing tool, and eco-savvy consumers will recognize
        this and consider it greenwashing. When selecting a green web host, dig
        into the company’s background and see what else they are doing about
        lightening their environmental footprint.
